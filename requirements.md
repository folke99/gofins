#Requirements
### Scope

The thesis will focus on analyzing and improving the existing Golang package for the FINS protocol, which is used to integrate Omron PLCs into industrial automation systems. The scope will include identifying key deficiencies in the current implementation, proposing enhancements to improve reliability, performance, and scalability, and implementing proof-of-concept solutions.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this thesis are:

- **Feature Enhancement:**

- Optimize network behavior in regards to write-back addresses and ports, enabling clustered deployments.
- Implement missing functionalities such as device "alive" status checks to ensure continuous monitoring and operational reliability.
- Provide support for advanced error handling mechanisms.

- **Documentation and Usability:**
- Improve the package documentation to provide clear guidance for developers and system integrators.
- Develop example configurations and usage patterns to facilitate easier adoption.

### Deliverables

The thesis will result in the following key deliverables:

- A comprehensive analysis report identifying current limitations and their impact.
- An enhanced Golang package with implemented improvements and optimizations.
- Performance evaluation and comparative analysis report.
- A user guide and best practices document for deploying the improved package.
- Recommendations for future improvements and potential industry adoption strategies.


### Limitations

The research will focus on the Golang implementation only and will not cover other programming languages. Additionally, the study will primarily consider the integration of Omron PLCs in industrial automation, without exploring cross-protocol compatibility beyond the defined benchmarks.

### Methodology

The study will follow a structured approach that includes:

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Engaging with stakeholders to define critical requirements.
2. **Literature Review:** Investigating existing research and solutions for industrial PLC communications.
3. **Experimental Development:** Prototyping improvements and validating against real-world scenarios.
4. **Evaluation and Benchmarking:** Measuring performance, scalability, and reliability post-implementation.

### Research Questions (suggestions)

- How can the performance of the Golang FINS package be optimized to match or exceed competing protocols like Siemens and Modbus?

- How can improved documentation and usability features facilitate wider adoption of the Golang FINS package in industrial automation?

- How do industry best practices influence the development of robust communication protocols for PLC integration?

- What benchmarking methodologies can be used to evaluate the efficiency and reliability of the improved package?
